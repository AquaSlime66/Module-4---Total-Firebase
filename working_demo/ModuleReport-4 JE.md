|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-|-|
|Did you implement the entire set of unique requirements as described in the Module Description document in I-Learn? |No | As described in the readME(s) I did not complete the assignment.|
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code in your software and include useful comments?                              |Yes*    | I made some of the Javascript from ChatGPT and other projects, but it was mostly provided from the tutorials. |
|Did you use the correct README.md template from the Module Description document in I-Learn?                         | Yes| |
|Did you completely populate the README.md template?                                                                 | | |
|Did you create the video, publish it on YouTube, and reference it in the README.md file?                            | | |
|Did you publish the code with the README.md (in the top-level folder) into a public GitHub repository?              | Yes| |

### Retrospective
- **What learning strategies worked well in this module?**
  I had a ton of previous expierence with Firebase, and access to tons of tutorials and past working projects. The first part of this module, setting up Firebase, initializing a new app, creating a database, and then connecting it to a project in VS code. Previous expierence came *heavily* in handy.

- **What strategies (or lack of strategy) did not work well?**
  I depended way too heavily on my tutorials. In my defense, the tutorial with authentication *did* work when I created it back in the day. I poured through documentation, ran bad code through ChatGPT, hypothetically, I should've been able to complete it. I didn't ask anyone for help with anything, and that was my failed strategy. I didn't rely on anything that could personally help me, and that was where everything went wrong.

- **How can you improve in the next module?**
  Ask for help, simple as that. I thought I knew enough to complete this project without too much additional help, and I do know Firebase very well. This was a very frustrating project as nothing I've done before worked. Asking for external help is something I really need to work on.
